# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-with-Pytorch
In this repository, I've gathered and presented my project submissions for Udacity's [Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-nanodegree--nd229).

## Project 1: Find Donors for CharityML
This project focused on evaluating and optimizing supervised learning algorithms for CharityML, a fictitious charity organization based in Silicon Valley. The goal of the project was to identify the algorithm that would generate the highest donations while adhering to marketing constraints.

Throughout the project, I gained expertise in the following areas:

- Utilizing supervised learning algorithms for model evaluation and comparison.
- Tuning models to meet specific constraints and optimize performance.
- Understanding the importance of preprocessing data and applying it appropriately.
- Establishing benchmarks to evaluate solution performance.
- Exploring various supervised learning algorithms and their effectiveness on specific datasets.
- Assessing the adequacy of candidate solution models for the given problem.


## Project 2: Create Your Own Image Classifier
The project focused on the decision-making process for building or buying an object detection algorithm for a self-driving car startup. I was tasked with evaluating the performance of a neural network model in comparison to a company called Detectocorp, which claimed an 80% accuracy rate on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Throughout the project, I developed and showcased the following skills:

- Training a neural network to recognize objects in images.
- Evaluating the model's performance and comparing it to Detectocorp's algorithm.
- Building an image classifier and object detection system using PyTorch.
- Applying data augmentation techniques and implementing neural networks.
- Exploring and preparing the CIFAR-10 dataset for training and testing.
- Training the neural network and evaluating its performance on the test set.


## Project 3: Creating Customer Segments
The project involved analyzing real-life data from a German mail-order sales company. The main objective was to identify specific segments of the population that are most likely to become purchasers through a mailout campaign. My task was to leverage unsupervised learning techniques to cluster the general population and determine which clusters represented the company's primary user base. Prior to applying machine learning methods, I had to clean and preprocess the data to make it usable.

Through this project, I gained valuable skills in the following areas:

- Applying dimensionality reduction techniques to identify significant features and associations within the data.
- Employing clustering techniques to understand the organization of data points and potentially utilizing clusters as features in supervised learning tasks.
- Handling untidy or unprocessed data and making decisions about data quality and preprocessing.
